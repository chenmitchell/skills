# Business Automation Strategy — by AfrexAI ⚡

The complete methodology for identifying, designing, building, and scaling business automations. Platform-agnostic — works with n8n, Zapier, Make, Power Automate, custom code, AI agents, or any combination.

## What This Skill Does

Turns your AI agent into an automation strategist that can:

- **Audit** any business for automation opportunities with ROI calculations
- **Prioritize** using ICE-R scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease, Reliability)
- **Design** workflow blueprints with error handling, retry logic, and monitoring
- **Select** the right platform (no-code vs low-code vs custom vs AI)
- **Build** reliable integrations with rate limiting, circuit breakers, and DLQ patterns
- **Test** with a complete test pyramid (unit → integration → E2E → chaos)
- **Monitor** with dashboards, alerts, and weekly review frameworks
- **Scale** from 10 to 10,000+ executions with optimization strategies
- **Govern** with registries, change management, and quarterly reviews
- **Add AI** to workflows with confidence thresholds and human-in-the-loop patterns
