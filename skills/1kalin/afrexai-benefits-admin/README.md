# Benefits Administration Agent

AI-powered employee benefits management — 401(k), health insurance, PTO, HSA, and compliance.

## What It Does

- **Benchmarks** your benefits against market data by company size and industry
- **Designs** 401(k) plans (Safe Harbor vs Traditional, match optimization, vesting)
- **Optimizes** health insurance costs (HDHP+HSA, ICHRA, level-funded, reference-based pricing)
- **Builds** PTO policies with state compliance and unlimited vs structured analysis
- **Generates** 12-month compliance calendars (ACA, Form 5500, open enrollment)
- **Models** cost scenarios and calculates total compensation per employee
