## Quick Assessment: /crisis-check

When a user reports an emerging situation, immediately classify it:

```yaml
crisis_assessment:
  situation: "[one-line description]"
  severity: "[SEV-1 | SEV-2 | SEV-3 | SEV-4]"
  type: "[reputational | operational | financial | legal | personnel | cyber | product | environmental]"
  blast_radius: "[internal-only | customers | partners | public | regulatory]"
  time_pressure: "[minutes | hours | days | weeks]"
  containable: "[yes | partially | no]"
  media_attention: "[none | possible | likely | active]"
  recommended_response: "[monitor | prepare | activate | all-hands]"
```

### Severity Matrix

| Level | Description | Response Time | Who's Involved | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| SEV-1 | Existential — threatens company survival | < 1 hour | CEO + Board + Legal + External counsel | Data breach of millions, CEO arrested, product causes harm, regulatory shutdown |
| SEV-2 | Severe — major revenue/reputation impact | < 4 hours | C-suite + Department heads + Comms | Key client public complaint, employee viral post, significant outage, lawsuit filed |
| SEV-3 | Moderate — contained but needs management | < 24 hours | Department head + Comms + Legal review | Negative press article, minor data leak, employee misconduct, vendor failure |
| SEV-4 | Low — monitor and prepare | < 48 hours | Comms team + Monitoring | Industry negative trend, competitor attack, social media grumbling, minor complaint |

---

## Phase 1: Crisis Detection & Early Warning

### 12 Early Warning Signals

Monitor these continuously — crises rarely appear without warning:

1. **Customer complaint spike** — 3x normal volume in 24 hours
2. **Social media velocity** — brand mentions increasing >200% hour-over-hour
3. **Employee chatter** — Glassdoor reviews, internal Slack sentiment shift
4. **Journalist inquiries** — any reporter asking for comment = crisis in 24-48 hours
5. **Regulatory correspondence** — any letter from a regulator, however routine it seems
6. **Key person behavior change** — executive sudden absence, unusual access patterns
7. **Vendor/partner warnings** — supply chain disruptions, contract disputes escalating
8. **Financial anomalies** — unexpected revenue drops, unusual transactions, audit flags
9. **Competitor moves** — poaching key staff, undercutting pricing, patent filings
10. **Legal signals** — demand letters, subpoenas, cease-and-desist notices
11. **Technical indicators** — unusual system access, data exfiltration patterns, outage patterns
12. **Industry contagion** — similar company hit by scandal in your space (you're next)

## Phase 2: Crisis Response Team (CRT) Activation

### Team Structure

```yaml
crisis_response_team:
  incident_commander:
    role: "Single decision-maker — usually CEO for SEV-1, VP/Director for SEV-2+"
    responsibilities:
      - Final approval on all external communications
      - Resource allocation decisions
      - Escalation/de-escalation calls

      - Compensation/credit decisions
```

### Activation Checklist (First 60 Minutes)

```
□ Incident Commander identified and briefed
□ CRT members notified — war room (physical or virtual) established
□ Information blackout: NO external communications until first statement approved
□ Document preservation hold issued (legal)
□ Facts gathered: What happened? When? Who's affected? What do we know vs. don't know?
□ Severity level assigned
□ Communication channels locked: only CRT posts externally
□ Social media accounts secured (change passwords if credential compromise)
□ Employee briefing: "We're aware, investigating, do NOT speak to media/post on social"
□ First holding statement drafted and legal-reviewed
□ Stakeholder notification list prioritized
□ Dedicated communication channel created (Slack/Teams war room)
□ Timeline document started
```

---

## Phase 3: Stakeholder Communication

### Communication Priority Order

Always communicate in this order — getting it wrong creates secondary crises:

1. **Affected parties** (customers whose data leaked, employees who are impacted)
2. **Regulators** (if legally required — check notification timelines)
3. **Employees** (before they read it in the news)
4. **Board/investors** (before they get calls from journalists)
5. **Partners/vendors** (if their operations are affected)
6. **Media** (when you're ready, not when they force you)
7. **General public** (via website/social, if warranted)

### The CARE Framework for Crisis Statements

Every crisis communication must hit all four elements:

- **C — Concern**: Acknowledge the situation and express genuine concern for those affected
- **A — Accountability**: Own what you know, don't deflect or minimize
- **R — Remedy**: What you're doing RIGHT NOW to fix it
- **E — Evolution**: How you'll prevent this from happening again + when the next update comes

### Statement Templates by Crisis Type

#### Data Breach / Cyber Incident

```
[HEADLINE]: Security Incident Update — [Date]

We discovered [what happened] on [date]. We immediately [containment actions taken].

What we know:
- [Specific data types potentially affected]

```

### Anti-Patterns in Crisis Communication

**NEVER do these:**

| Don't | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| "We take this very seriously" (alone) | Empty — everyone says it | Show what you're DOING |
| "A small number of users" (when it's millions) | Will be fact-checked instantly | Give the real number or say "we're still determining" |
| Blame the victim | Creates rage and lawsuits | Own the failure |
| "No evidence of misuse" (day 1 of breach) | You can't possibly know yet | "Our investigation is ongoing" |
| Bury the announcement (Friday 5pm) | Everyone knows this trick now | Rip the bandaid — announce when ready |
| Drip bad news over days | Each drip is a new news cycle | Get all the bad news out at once |
| Let lawyers write the whole statement | Reads like a liability shield, not a human | Legal reviews, comms writes |
| Go silent after first statement | Silence = hiding | Commit to update schedule and keep it |
| CEO avoids being the face | "They don't care enough to show up" | CEO fronts SEV-1 and SEV-2 |
| Delete social media posts/evidence | Screenshots already exist + obstruction risk | Leave it, address it |

---

## Phase 4: Media Management

### Press Inquiry Response Protocol

```yaml
media_protocol:
  step_1_receive:
    action: "Log EVERY inquiry — reporter name, outlet, deadline, question"
    rule: "NEVER say 'no comment' — say 'we'll get back to you by [time]'"
    deadline_rule: "Always ask their deadline. If none stated, assume 4 hours"

  step_2_assess:
    action: "Route to Communications Lead immediately"
    questions:
      - "What do they already know? (Often more than you think)"
      - "Who else are they talking to?"
      - "What's the story angle?"
      - "Is this hostile or informational?"

  step_3_respond:
    options:
      written_statement: "Default for most situations — controlled, reviewable"
      background_briefing: "Off-record to shape narrative — ONLY with trusted reporters"
      on_record_interview: "CEO/spokesperson — only when story is significant and you want to lead"
      no_response: "ONLY if legal counsel advises (active litigation, regulatory investigation)"

  step_4_track:
    action: "Monitor resulting coverage within 2 hours of publication"
    follow_up: "Correct factual errors immediately with evidence"
```

### Media Spokesperson Rules

1. **Three key messages maximum** — prepare them before ANY interaction
2. **Bridge technique**: "What I can tell you is..." / "The important thing here is..." / "Let me give you the full picture..."
3. **Never speculate** — "I don't want to speculate, but here's what we know..."
4. **Never go off-record** unless you'd be fine seeing it in print anyway
5. **Repeat your key message at least 3 times** — journalists use quotes, make sure the right ones are available
6. **Assume everything is recorded** — always
7. **Don't fill silence** — answer the question and stop talking

### Social Media Crisis Response

```yaml
social_response_tiers:
  tier_1_viral_negative:
    threshold: ">1000 engagements or trending"
    response: "Official statement post + pin. CEO/founder post if SEV-1."
    timing: "Within 2 hours"
    tone: "Direct, human, accountable"

  tier_2_angry_customer_public:
    threshold: ">100 engagements, verified customer"
    response: "Public acknowledgment + DM to resolve"
    timing: "Within 1 hour"
    tone: "Empathetic, solution-oriented"

  tier_3_misinformation:
    threshold: "Factually wrong claims gaining traction"
    response: "Factual correction with evidence (screenshot, data, link)"
    timing: "Within 4 hours"
    tone: "Calm, factual, non-combative"

  tier_4_troll_attack:
    threshold: "Bad-faith actors, not real customers"
    response: "Ignore unless it's gaining credible traction"
    timing: "Monitor only"
    tone: "Do not engage"
```

---

## Phase 5: Legal & Regulatory Response

### Regulatory Notification Requirements

**Data Breach Notification Timelines (key jurisdictions):**

| Jurisdiction | Deadline | Who to Notify | Threshold |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| GDPR (EU/UK) | 72 hours | Supervisory authority + affected individuals if high risk | Any personal data breach |
| US — State laws | 30-90 days (varies by state) | State AG + affected individuals | PII of state residents |
| US — HIPAA | 60 days | HHS + individuals; media if >500 | Protected health information |
| US — SEC (public co) | 4 business days (Form 8-K) | SEC + shareholders | Material cybersecurity incident |
| US — NYDFS | 72 hours | NYDFS | Cybersecurity events for covered entities |
| US — FTC | ASAP (no fixed timeline) | FTC if >500 people | Health breach notification |
| Canada (PIPEDA) | ASAP | Privacy Commissioner + affected individuals | Real risk of significant harm |
| Australia (NDB) | 30 days | OAIC + affected individuals | Eligible data breach |

**Critical rule**: When in doubt, notify early. Late notification = separate violation with its own penalties.

### Document Preservation

```yaml
legal_hold:
  trigger: "Any SEV-1 or SEV-2 crisis, any litigation threat, any regulatory inquiry"
  scope:
    - All emails, messages, documents related to the incident
    - System logs, access logs, audit trails
    - Employee communications (Slack, Teams, email)
    - Security camera footage if relevant
    - Phone records if relevant
  actions:
    - Issue written preservation notice to all custodians
    - Disable auto-delete on relevant systems
    - Preserve backup tapes/snapshots
    - Document chain of custody
  warning: "Spoliation of evidence = separate legal liability. NEVER delete anything after a crisis."
```

### Insurance Activation

```
□ Review cyber liability / D&O / general liability policies within 24 hours
□ Notify insurer per policy terms (often 24-72 hour requirement)
□ Document ALL costs from incident start (forensics, legal, PR, remediation, business interruption)
□ Confirm coverage for: incident response, forensics, notification costs, credit monitoring, legal defense, regulatory fines, business interruption
□ Engage panel counsel if policy requires it (using non-panel counsel may void coverage)
```

## Phase 8: Crisis Preparedness (Pre-Crisis)

### Annual Crisis Readiness Audit

Score your organization 1-5 on each dimension:

| Dimension | 1 (Unprepared) | 3 (Basic) | 5 (Battle-Ready) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **CRT defined** | No team identified | Names listed but untrained | Team trained, roles clear, contact tree tested |
| **Statement templates** | None | Generic template exists | Templates for 8+ scenario types, pre-approved by legal |
| **Media training** | No training | CEO did one session | CEO + 2 spokespersons trained annually, mock interviews |
| **Monitoring** | Manual/ad-hoc | Google Alerts only | Real-time social listening + customer signal dashboards |
| **Playbooks** | None | One generic playbook | Scenario-specific playbooks for top 5 risks |
| **Tabletop exercises** | Never done | Did one years ago | Quarterly exercises rotating scenarios |
| **Regulatory knowledge** | "Legal handles it" | Know major requirements | Notification matrix by jurisdiction, pre-drafted filings |
| **Insurance** | "We have insurance" | Know policy exists | Annual review, know coverage limits, panel counsel listed |
| **Employee training** | Nothing | Onboarding mention | Annual training: media policy, social media, who to escalate to |
| **Communication infrastructure** | Email only | Slack/Teams + email | Redundant channels + offline contacts + dark website ready |

**Scoring**: 10-20 = Critical gaps. 21-35 = Developing. 36-45 = Good. 46-50 = Excellent.

### Scenario Planning: Top 10 Crises to Prepare For

Build playbooks for each:

1. **Data breach** — customer PII exposed
2. **Product failure** — critical bug affecting customers
3. **Employee misconduct** — harassment, fraud, discrimination
4. **Executive departure** — sudden, unexpected loss of key leader
5. **Financial distress** — cash crunch, missed payroll, covenant breach
6. **Regulatory action** — investigation, fine, compliance order
7. **Social media firestorm** — viral negative content
8. **Litigation** — class action, IP dispute, customer lawsuit
9. **Vendor/partner failure** — critical dependency goes down
10. **Natural disaster / pandemic** — operational continuity threat

### Tabletop Exercise Template

```yaml
tabletop_exercise:
  scenario: "[Brief crisis description — 2-3 paragraphs with escalating details]"
  duration: "90 minutes"

  structure:
    phase_1_detection: # 15 min
      inject: "[How the crisis is first discovered]"
      questions:
        - "Who do you call first?"
        - "What's the severity level?"
        - "What information do you need before acting?"

    phase_2_escalation: # 20 min
      inject: "[New information that makes it worse — media call, second incident, larger scope]"
      questions:
        - "How does this change your response?"
        - "What's your first external communication?"
        - "What are the legal implications?"

    phase_3_public: # 20 min
      inject: "[It's now public — social media, press article, regulatory inquiry]"
      questions:
        - "Walk through your public statement"
        - "How do you handle the media inquiry?"
        - "What are you telling employees?"

    phase_4_recovery: # 15 min
      inject: "[Crisis is contained but damage is done]"
      questions:
        - "What's your 30-day recovery plan?"
        - "How do you prevent recurrence?"
        - "What would you do differently?"

    debrief: # 20 min
      - "What gaps did we find?"
      - "What worked well?"
      - "Action items with owners and deadlines"
```

## Phase 9: Industry-Specific Crisis Guides

### SaaS / Technology

- **Outage crisis**: Status page protocol, customer communication cadence (every 30 min during active outage), SLA credit calculation, RCA publication within 5 business days
- **Data breach**: See Phase 5 notification requirements + consider SOC 2 implications, vendor notification chain
- **AI/algorithm failure**: Transparency about what went wrong, human oversight messaging, bias audit if applicable

### Healthcare

- **Patient data (HIPAA)**: 60-day notification to HHS, individual notice, media notice if >500 in a state
- **Clinical errors**: Work with malpractice counsel first, peer review privilege considerations
- **Drug/device recall**: FDA reporting requirements, healthcare provider notification

### Financial Services

- **Trading errors**: Regulatory reporting (SEC/FINRA), customer notification, error trade policies
- **Fraud/AML**: SAR filing (no customer notification for SARs), law enforcement coordination
- **System outage**: Reg SCI notification, customer access restoration priority

### Legal

- **Client data breach**: State bar notification, malpractice carrier notification, client notification with privilege considerations
- **Attorney misconduct**: State bar self-reporting requirements, firm liability assessment
- **Conflict of interest**: Ethical wall implementation, client consent or withdrawal

### Construction / Manufacturing

- **Workplace accident**: OSHA reporting (8 hours for fatality, 24 hours for hospitalization), workers' comp, family notification protocol
- **Product recall**: CPSC reporting, supply chain notification, customer remedy program
- **Environmental incident**: EPA/state agency reporting, remediation plan, community notification

## Phase 10: Crisis Communication Scoring

### Rate your crisis response: 0-100

| Dimension | Weight | 0-25 (Poor) | 50 (Adequate) | 75-100 (Excellent) |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | 20% | >24h to first statement | 4-8h | <2h, proactive |
| **Accuracy** | 20% | Errors corrected later, credibility damaged | Mostly accurate, minor gaps | 100% factual, verified before release |
| **Transparency** | 15% | Minimized, deflected, or hid information | Shared basics | Proactively shared bad news, admitted unknowns |
| **Empathy** | 15% | Legalistic, cold, focused on company | Acknowledged impact | Genuine concern, specific actions for affected |
| **Consistency** | 10% | Contradictory messages across channels | Mostly consistent | Single source of truth, all channels aligned |
| **Follow-through** | 10% | Went silent after first statement | Some updates | Committed to schedule, delivered every update |
| **Recovery** | 10% | No systemic changes, could happen again | Some fixes | Root cause addressed, preventive measures shipped |

**Scoring**: 0-40 = Crisis mismanaged (likely secondary crisis). 41-60 = Survived but damaged. 61-80 = Handled well. 81-100 = Textbook response, may emerge stronger.

## Edge Cases & Advanced Scenarios

### Multi-Crisis (Two Crises at Once)

- Assign separate Incident Commanders — never have one person running two crises
- Check for connection between crises (often they're related)
- Prioritize by impact to affected people, not to the company
- Consolidate communications if crises are related

### Crisis During Major Event (Product Launch, Fundraise, IPO)

- Default: pause the event. Don't launch into a crisis
- Exception: if the crisis is unrelated and minor (SEV-4), proceed with heightened monitoring
- Fundraise/IPO: immediate counsel with securities lawyers — disclosure obligations

### Hostile Takeover / Activist Investor

- Board-level response only — not operational team
- Engage specialized IR counsel and PR firm immediately
- Employee messaging: "Business as usual, leadership is handling"
- Do NOT engage on social media

### Whistleblower Situations

- Legal privilege: route through counsel immediately
- No retaliation — document this explicitly
- Assess if self-reporting is advantageous (often reduces penalties)
- Separate investigation from business response

### International / Multi-Jurisdiction

- Identify all jurisdictions where affected people reside
- Notification requirements differ by jurisdiction — map them ALL
- Translate communications for affected populations
- Consider cultural differences in crisis communication expectations
- Time zone coordination for global response team

### Social Media Employee Crisis

- Employee posts something damaging/offensive
- Step 1: Is this a personal view or did they represent the company?
- Step 2: Document everything (screenshots) before any action
- Step 3: HR/legal review — termination decisions are permanent, don't rush
- Step 4: If public response needed, separate individual from company
- Step 5: Do NOT pile on publicly — handle privately, make one clear public statement
