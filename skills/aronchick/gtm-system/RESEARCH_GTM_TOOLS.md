## Specific Recommendations for Expanso

### Why Reo.Dev Makes Sense (Eventually)

Reo.Dev is specifically built for developer tool companies. Their signals include:
- **npm/package installs** - See who's installing Bacalhau
- **GitHub activity** - Stars, forks, issues on your repo
- **Docs visits** - Who's reading your documentation
- **API/SDK usage** - First-party telemetry
- **Cloud sign-ups** - Free tier activity
- **Job postings** - Companies hiring for skills you solve

This is 10x more relevant than generic B2B intent data for a company like Expanso.

**BUT:** It's enterprise-priced. Save for when you have:
- Dedicated sales/BD person
- Budget for tooling
- Clear ICP definition

### What to Do Today

1. **Use the GTM system I built** - It's working now, $0/mo
2. **Sign up for F5Bot** - Free, takes 2 minutes
3. **Create Apollo.io account** - Free tier is generous
4. **Add Syften later** - When you want Slack/webhook alerts

### Content/Community Signals to Monitor

For Bacalhau/Expanso, watch for discussions about:
- "distributed computing" on HN/Reddit
- "compute over data" mentions
- "edge computing" + "data processing"
- Competitor mentions: Ray, Dask, Spark (for specific use cases)
- "IPFS" + "compute" combinations
- "wasm" / "webassembly" + "cloud" or "distributed"
- Job postings for "data engineer" + "distributed"

## Tools That Shut Down / Got Acquired

For awareness - these were popular but no longer independent:

| Tool | Status |
|------|--------|
| Orbit.love | Appears to be down (DNS error) |
| Calixa | Acquired/shut down |
| June.so | Acquired by Amplitude |
| Clearbit | Acquired by HubSpot |
| Correlated | Appears inactive |
| Toplyne | Appears inactive |

The PLG/GTM space has significant churn. Bet on established players or build custom.

## Open-Source Alternatives

If you want to self-host more:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **PostHog** | Product analytics (open-source) |
| **Matomo** | Web analytics (self-hosted) |
| **Plausible** | Simple analytics |
| **n8n** | Workflow automation |
| **Custom scripts** | What we built today |

## Integration with Our GTM System

The custom system I built can be extended to:

1. **Pull from Syften webhooks** - Ingest signals automatically
2. **Sync with Apollo.io** - Export contacts, import enrichment
3. **Connect to Clay** - Use their data, push to our DB
4. **Alert via Telegram** - Already working

### Adding Syften Integration (Example)

When you're ready, add to the GTM system:
```python
# In gtm.py, add endpoint to receive Syften webhooks
@app.route('/webhook/syften', methods=['POST'])
def syften_webhook():
    signal = request.json
    # Save to signals table
    save_signal(source='syften', data=signal)
    return 'OK'
```
