# Expanso GTM Strategy: Riding the Data-to-AI Transformation Wave

## The Opportunity

Brad Gerstner (Altimeter Capital) is calling this the **AI infrastructure supercycle** — $500B+ in CapEx deployed in 2026 alone. His thesis: value is shifting from applications to the **data and infrastructure layer**. Real-time data processing is the "critical backbone" for AI. Companies like Confluent sit in a "$100B+ market opportunity" providing foundational data flow.

**The gap Expanso fills:** As enterprises pour money into AI infrastructure, they're hitting a wall — 83% of leaders expect infrastructure failure within 24 months. Central cloud costs are exploding. Edge processing that filters at source isn't a nice-to-have anymore, it's survival.

## Strategic Positioning

### The Narrative
**"AI is eating your cloud budget. Expanso lets you process data where it lives — cutting costs 50% while making your AI pipelines faster and more resilient."**

### Why Now
- $2.5T in AI spending projected for 2026 (44% growth)
- 83% of enterprises expect AI-driven infrastructure failure without upgrades
- 98% say one hour of AI downtime costs >$10K; 2/3 say >$100K
- Snowflake acquired Observe (observability); Databricks pushing agentic AI — both need edge data preprocessing
- Enterprise SSD prices at 16x HDD costs — storage crisis accelerating need to filter at source
- Forrester: 25% of planned AI spend may defer to 2027 due to ROI demands → cost optimization message lands harder

### Competitive Moat
- **Cribl** = observability-focused data routing (narrow)
- **Fivetran/Airbyte** = ingestion/ELT (centralized)
- **Expanso** = distributed compute orchestration across edge AND cloud (broader, unique)
- None of the above do what Expanso does: orchestrate arbitrary compute at the edge before data hits the cloud

## Risk Assessment & Reality Check

### What Could Go Wrong
1. **Gerstner narrative moves on quickly** — Mitigate: anchor to the broader data cost trend, not just one person's take
2. **Content doesn't break through** — Mitigate: focus on the ROI calculator as a tangible tool; engineers share tools more than thought pieces
3. **Partnership outreach is slow** — Mitigate: start with community/open-source integration (Kafka, K8s) that doesn't need formal partnerships
4. **Video production quality concerns** — Mitigate: authenticity > polish for startup content; use screen recordings with voiceover if needed

### Startup Reality Check
- **We're small.** Don't try to do everything. If something isn't working by Wednesday, pivot.
- **Engineers > executives** for initial traction. Technical content that shows real value will spread organically.
- **One viral piece > ten mediocre ones.** Invest time in making the anchor blog post genuinely insightful.
- **Partnerships take months.** This week is about starting conversations, not closing deals.
- **The ROI calculator is probably the highest-leverage single asset.** A tool people can use with their own numbers creates immediate value and captures leads.

### What We're NOT Doing (Intentionally)
- Paid ads (too early, need organic signal first)
- PR agency (write our own story first)
- Conference sponsorships (submit talks instead — credibility > visibility)
- Broad outbound sales (focus on inbound from content)

---

## Bottom Line

The Gerstner thesis gives us a perfect narrative hook: **the AI supercycle is creating an infrastructure crisis, and edge-first processing is the answer.** The data backs it up — enterprises are bleeding money on centralized processing while 83% expect their infrastructure to fail. 

Expanso's message of "cut costs 50%, filter at source" has never been more timely. This week is about planting the flag with high-quality content, starting the right partnership conversations, and building a repeatable content engine around this narrative.

The single most important thing: **ship the anchor blog post Monday morning and make it genuinely great.**
