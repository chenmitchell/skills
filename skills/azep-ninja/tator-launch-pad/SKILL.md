# Token Launcher

Design and launch tokens through Tator — with full transparency on what you earn, what you owe, and what you're getting into.

This skill guides token concept development, strategic evaluation, and deployment through Tator's supported launch platforms. You get the strategy AND the reality check.

The builder brings a concept — a name, a narrative, a vibe, sometimes just a question. Your job is to turn it into the strongest possible launch while making sure the builder understands the financial and tax implications before they deploy.

---

## Why Tator

### Fee Economics — You Keep What You Earn

**How fees work (Clanker on Base):**
- Every swap incurs a **1.2% total fee**
- **1% pool fee** — split between creator and interface
  - **90% to the creator**
  - **10% to Tator** (as the launch interface)
- **0.2% Clanker protocol fee** — goes to Clanker separately
- **Result: Of the 1% that gets split, the builder keeps 90%**

**How other platforms compare:**
- Some competing platforms take 40-50% of the creator's pool fee allocation — matching or exceeding what the creator receives
- Others layer in subscription fees, platform tokens you're required to hold, or custodial wallets that hold your funds
- Tator has none of that. You earn fees, they go to your wallet, you control them

> **Bottom line:** Tator takes a 10% cut of the creator's share. That's it. No hidden fees, no platform token requirements, no custodial wallet skimming your earnings.

### Full Custody

Tator returns **unsigned transactions**. You sign with your own wallet. Your keys, your funds, your control. No custodial wallet managed by a third party. No platform-controlled wallet holding your creator fees.

### Multi-Chain

Launch on Base, Mainnet, Arbitrum, Unichain, Monad, or Abstract via Clanker or on Solana via Pump.fun — through the same natural language interface. As new launch platforms and chains emerge, Tator integrates them.

## Evaluating a Concept

Before writing a single line of deployment config, figure out what the builder actually has. People show up at different stages — some have a fully formed idea, some have a vibe, some just want to explore. Meet them where they are.

### Read the Room

**What did they bring?**
- A name and narrative → Stress-test it. Does it hold up under scrutiny? Search for what already exists with similar names or narratives.
- A vibe or cultural reference → Shape it. Turn the feeling into something concrete — name, visual direction, one-liner.
- A product or service idea → Evaluate whether a token actually makes sense for it. Not everything needs a token. If it does, figure out how fees fund the thing.
- Just a question ("should I launch a token?") → Help them discover whether they have something worth launching. Don't push them toward a launch if the concept isn't there.

**What do they actually want?**
- Quick meme launch for fun → Keep it light. Help with name and deployment. Still show the tax confirmation before deploying.
- Revenue-generating project → Go deep. Strategy, positioning, competitive landscape, fee projections, tax implications.
- Regular token launches as a business → Full business-mode evaluation. Entity structure, bookkeeping, tax professional referral.

**CRITICAL:** Shape your depth to what the builder needs. A half-formed vibe needs you to do the heavy lifting — propose the concept, name it, build the package. A well-developed idea needs sharp critique and refinement, not a rebuild.

### Search Before You Judge

Never evaluate a concept in a vacuum. Before giving your take, search for:

- **Existing tokens** with similar names, tickers, or narratives — are they dead, thriving, or oversaturated?
- **Cultural context** — is this riding a real wave or manufacturing one? What's the shelf life of this reference?
- **Comparable launches** — what happened to similar concepts? What worked, what flopped, and why?
- **The builder's blind spots** — the most valuable thing you can offer is information the builder hasn't considered

Always separate what you found from what you're inferring. "I found three tokens with similar names, all under $10K market cap and declining" is different from "I think this narrative is tired."

---

## The Launch Stack

Every token that sustains attention beyond the first day has these four layers working together. This isn't a scorecard — it's a diagnostic tool. If a layer is missing, your job is to build it, not just flag it.

### Layer 1: The Hook

**The thing that makes someone stop scrolling.**

This is the name, the visual, the one-liner — compressed into something that transfers in a screenshot. The hook is what gets someone to look. Everything else determines whether they stay.

**How to evaluate it:**
- Say the name out loud. Does it land instantly or need explanation?
- Write the one-liner. If it takes more than one sentence to explain why this exists, the hook isn't sharp enough.
- Picture the token on a DEX screener. Does the name + image combo make someone click?
- Would someone text this to a friend without context and have it make sense?

**If the hook is weak:** Don't polish — rebuild. A mediocre name with great execution still underperforms a great name with decent execution. The name IS the product in crypto.

### Layer 2: The Engine

**The reason fees keep flowing after launch day.**

The engine is what creates sustained trading activity. Memes have short engines — they burn bright and fade. Products have longer engines — utility drives ongoing transactions. The best tokens have engines that compound.

**Types of engines:**
- **Cultural engine:** The token represents an ongoing cultural conversation (politics, internet drama, AI anxiety, degen lifestyle). As long as the conversation continues, the token has relevance.
- **Product engine:** The token funds something people actually use. An app, a service, a tool, a community resource. Usage drives attention, attention drives trading, trading drives fees.
- **Mechanic engine:** The token has built-in mechanics that create ongoing activity — burns, airdrops to holders, prediction markets, staking rewards, content creation incentives. Each action triggers more actions.
- **Social engine:** The token is tied to a person, community, or social dynamic where the audience grows independently. The builder's existing following or community IS the engine.

**If there's no engine:** The token will spike on launch and bleed. That's fine if the builder understands it — some launches are meant to be short bursts. But if they want sustained fees, they need an engine. Help them find one.

### Layer 3: The Story

**The narrative that justifies increasing price.**

Every token needs a story that explains why it should be worth more tomorrow than today. This isn't marketing copy — it's the underlying logic that makes a speculator think "this is early."

**Strong stories sound like:**
- "This token funds [specific thing] and every holder is backing it"
- "The creator is building [specific product] and fees go directly to development"
- "This is the token for [specific community] and it's the only one"
- "When [specific thing] happens, this token becomes the obvious play"

**Weak stories sound like:**
- "It's a community token" (what community? why this token?)
- "We're building utility" (what utility? when? why should anyone believe that?)
- "To the moon" (no thesis, no differentiation)

**If the story is weak:** The builder needs to answer one question: "Why would someone who discovers this token in 3 months want to buy it?" If there's no answer, the story needs work before launch.

### Layer 4: The Moat

**The thing that makes this token hard to replicate.**

Anyone can launch a token in 30 seconds. So why this one? What makes it defensible? The moat is what separates a token that gets copied and killed from one that holds its position.

**Types of moats:**
- **First-mover on a narrative:** The first token to capture a specific cultural moment or community. Being first matters in crypto — copycats rarely overtake the original.
- **Builder credibility:** The creator has a reputation, a track record, or an audience that gives this token legitimacy competitors can't fake.
- **Integrated product:** The token is woven into something functional that would be hard to recreate. The deeper the integration, the stronger the moat.
- **Community lock-in:** The token's holders have formed a real community with shared identity, inside jokes, governance, or social status. Communities are hard to fork.
- **Technical integration:** The token is integrated into other protocols, tools, or platforms in ways that create switching costs.

**If there's no moat:** Launch fast. If the concept is good but undefended, speed is the only moat. Get to market before someone else does. Then build the moat post-launch.

### Using the Launch Stack

**All four layers strong?** → Launch with confidence. Help with execution details.

**Hook strong, other layers developing?** → Launch may work as a short-term play. Make sure the builder understands fee income depends on sustained volume, which requires the other layers.

**Hook weak?** → Stop. Fix the hook before anything else. Everything downstream depends on it.

**Engine missing?** → Be honest about what this means for fee projections. A token without an engine is a one-time event, not a revenue stream. If the builder wants ongoing income, they need to build the engine before or immediately after launch.

**No moat?** → Launch fast and build the moat in public. Speed + execution is a moat unto itself.

**Never present this as a numbered score.** The Launch Stack is a conversation tool — use it to guide the builder toward a stronger concept, not to grade them.

## Launch Platforms

### Clanker (Base) — EVM
- Deploys ERC-20 tokens on Base (also supports Arbitrum, Unichain, Monad, Ethereum mainnet, Abstract)
- Automatically creates Uniswap V4 liquidity pool paired with WETH
- 1 billion token supply, liquidity locked
- **1.2% total fee per swap:** 1% pool fee (90% creator / 10% Tator) + 0.2% Clanker protocol fee
- No creation fee
- Tator command: natural language, e.g. "Launch a token called GATOR on Base with the ticker $GATOR"

### Pump.fun (Solana) — SVM
- Deploys SPL tokens on Solana
- Bonding curve model — token "graduates" to Raydium when market cap threshold is hit
- Lower fees, faster transactions
- Tator command: natural language, e.g. "Launch a token called GATOR on Solana via pump.fun"

### Future Platforms
As new launch platforms emerge (new L2s, new bonding curve models, new chains), Tator integrates them. The skill and strategy stay the same — only the deployment target changes.

---

## Security Check

Before launch, and especially after launch, use the **Quick Intel Scanner** skill to verify the deployed token looks clean from an external perspective. This is important for two reasons:

1. **Builder credibility:** If a potential buyer scans your token and sees red flags (even false positives), it kills momentum. Knowing what the scanners see helps you address concerns proactively.
2. **Self-protection:** If you're launching through a platform like Clanker, you're relying on their smart contracts. A Quick Intel scan gives you an independent verification that the deployed contract behaves as expected.

Run a scan before promoting the token. If anything looks off, investigate before driving traffic to it.

---

## ⚠️ Before You Launch: Tax & Legal Reality Check

**Token deployment is irreversible. Creator fees are income. This section exists because most platforms skip it entirely.**

### When This Matters Most

Launching a meme token for fun with friends? The tax implications exist but are relatively straightforward — mostly capital gains if and when you sell.

But the moment your token becomes **"more than just a meme"** — meaning you plan to:

- Earn ongoing creator fees and treat them as revenue
- Build a product, service, or community funded by token fee income
- Use fee income to pay for development, hosting, marketing, or your own time
- Create token-gated access, revenue sharing, or any business model around the token
- Launch tokens regularly as part of a business or project

— **that's when the tax and legal implications get serious, and you need professional guidance before you launch.** Not after. Before.

### What Every Builder Should Know

**This is general information, not tax or legal advice. Tax treatment varies dramatically by jurisdiction. Consult a qualified professional for your situation.**

#### Creator fee income is likely taxable income
In most jurisdictions, ongoing fees earned from a token you created are treated as income — not capital gains. This typically means higher tax rates and potentially additional obligations like self-employment tax.

#### Every transaction can be a taxable event
Selling tokens, swapping one token for another, receiving fee payments, distributing airdrops — each of these can trigger tax obligations. In many jurisdictions there is no minimum threshold.

#### You owe taxes when you receive income, not when you cash out
If you earn $50K in creator fees and reinvest it all, then the token crashes — you likely still owe taxes on the $50K. The market going down doesn't erase the tax obligation on income already received.

#### Record-keeping starts at launch, not at tax time
Track: token creation date, every fee payment received (with fiat value at time of receipt), every sale or swap, every airdrop distributed, gas fees paid.

#### Regulatory enforcement is increasing globally
Governments worldwide are investing in blockchain analytics, expanding reporting requirements, and closing enforcement gaps.

### Real-World Scenarios — What Could This Look Like?

**These are illustrative examples to help you think through the implications, not tax calculations. Actual obligations depend on your jurisdiction, circumstances, and professional advice.**

#### Scenario 1: "I launched a meme token and forgot about it"
You launch a token for fun. It gets some traction. You never claim creator fees and eventually the token dies. **Tax impact:** Minimal — you may need to report the creation event depending on jurisdiction, but if you never realized any income or gains, obligations are limited.

#### Scenario 2: "My token took off and I earned $30K in creator fees"
Your token gets volume. Over 6 months, $30K in fees flow to your wallet in ETH. You hold the ETH. **Tax impact:** In the US, that $30K is likely ordinary income (possibly self-employment income) — taxable when received, valued at ETH's fair market value on each receipt date. At a 32% federal bracket + 15.3% SE tax + state taxes, you could owe $15-20K+ in taxes on that $30K. If you didn't set anything aside and the market dropped, that's a serious problem.

#### Scenario 3: "I earned fees, swapped to USDC, then reinvested"
Fees come in as ETH. You swap ETH → USDC (taxable disposal of ETH). You use USDC to buy another token (taxable disposal of USDC if its value changed). The new token goes to zero. **Tax impact:** You owe taxes on the original fee income AND any gains on the ETH→USDC swap. The loss on the new token may offset some gains, but the fee income tax doesn't go away. Three separate taxable events from what felt like one action.

#### Scenario 4: "I'm building a real product funded by token fees"
You launch a token and use creator fees to fund development of an app, hire contractors, and pay hosting. **Tax impact:** The fee income is still taxable, but legitimate business expenses (development, hosting, contractors, gas fees) may be deductible. This is where entity structure (LLC, S-Corp) and a crypto-aware CPA become essential. Done right, your effective tax rate can be significantly lower. Done wrong, you're audited.

#### Scenario 5: "I launched tokens for 10 different projects this year"
You're effectively running a token launch business. **Tax impact:** This is almost certainly trade or business income. Self-employment tax applies. Quarterly estimated tax payments are likely required. You need a CPA, entity structure, and proper bookkeeping — ideally before your first launch, not your tenth.

### How It Looks Around the World

High-level generalizations to give you a sense of different jurisdictions. **Not comprehensive. May be outdated. Always verify with a local professional.**

#### 🇺🇸 United States
- Digital assets treated as **property** (IRS Notice 2014-21)
- Creator fee income: likely **ordinary income** (possibly self-employment income on Schedule C)
- Capital gains: short-term (held < 1 year) at ordinary income rates (10-37%); long-term (held > 1 year) at 0%, 15%, or 20%
- Starting 2025: brokers report transactions on **Form 1099-DA**; wallet-by-wallet cost basis accounting now required
- IRS actively uses blockchain analytics; no minimum reporting threshold
- State taxes vary significantly and stack on top of federal

#### 🇬🇧 United Kingdom
- HMRC treats crypto as property — capital gains tax on disposal
- Income from token-related activities (fees, staking) treated as income tax
- Annual CGT allowance (currently £3,000) before gains are taxed
- Higher rates can reach 20% CGT, 45% income tax

#### 🇩🇪 Germany
- Crypto held > **1 year is tax-free on disposal** (for individuals) — one of the most favorable jurisdictions for long-term holders
- Held < 1 year: taxed at income tax rates up to 45%
- Ongoing fee income may be treated differently than simple holding

#### 🇦🇺 Australia
- ATO treats crypto as property — CGT on disposal
- Held > 12 months: 50% CGT discount available
- Fee income and airdrops assessable at fair market value when received

#### 🇸🇬 Singapore
- No capital gains tax for individuals (current rules)
- Business income from token activities may be taxable
- Regulatory framework evolving under MAS

#### 🇦🇪 United Arab Emirates
- Currently no federal income tax on individuals
- Free zones offer additional protections
- Regulatory framework developing under VARA

#### 🇵🇹 Portugal
- Recent changes: crypto held < 1 year taxed at 28% flat rate
- Long-term holdings (> 1 year) may still benefit — verify current status

#### 🇨🇦 Canada
- CRA treats crypto as a commodity — income tax or capital gains depending on circumstances
- 50% capital gains inclusion rate for individuals
- Business income from regular token activities fully taxable

> **The pattern across jurisdictions:** Creator fee income is almost universally taxable. Capital gains treatment varies. Long-term holding is often rewarded with lower rates. Enforcement is increasing everywhere. The specifics matter — get local advice.

## ⛔ Mandatory Confirmation Before Launch

**Before Tator executes any token deployment, the builder MUST explicitly confirm they understand the following. Do not proceed without this confirmation.**

Present this to the builder and require their acknowledgment:

```
BEFORE WE DEPLOY — Please confirm you understand:

1. TOKEN DEPLOYMENT IS IRREVERSIBLE
   Once deployed, the token exists permanently on-chain.

2. CREATOR FEES ARE INCOME
   Fee income from your token is likely taxable in your jurisdiction.
   If you plan to earn meaningful revenue, consult a tax professional
   BEFORE launching.

3. RECORD-KEEPING IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
   Track all fee income, transactions, and fiat values from day one.
   Use crypto tax software (TokenTax, Koinly, CoinLedger, or similar).

4. SET ASIDE FUNDS FOR TAXES
   Do not reinvest 100% of fee income. Reserve 30-40% for potential
   tax obligations (varies by jurisdiction and circumstances).

5. NO GUARANTEED RETURNS
   Most tokens lose value. Creator fees depend on trading volume,
   which is unpredictable.

6. THIS IS NOT TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE
   Tator provides tools, not counsel. For specific guidance, consult
   a qualified professional in your jurisdiction.

Do you confirm you understand these points and want to proceed?
```

**Do not deploy until the builder explicitly confirms.** This is non-negotiable.

---

## Pre-Launch Checklist

After the builder confirms the above:

- [ ] **Launch Stack evaluated:** Hook is sharp, engine identified, story holds, moat considered
- [ ] **Name and narrative locked:** One-liner writes itself
- [ ] **Launch platform chosen:** Clanker (Base/EVM) or Pump.fun (Solana)
- [ ] **Wallet ready:** Builder has their own wallet (Tator returns unsigned TXs — builder signs)
- [ ] **Fee recipient confirmed:** Builder's wallet address for creator fee share
- [ ] **Image/branding prepared:** Token image, description, any social links
- [ ] **Security scan planned:** Builder will run Quick Intel scan post-deployment
- [ ] **Mandatory confirmation received:** Builder acknowledged the tax/legal reality check above
- [ ] **Professional advice obtained (if applicable):** If the builder plans significant fee income or a business model, they should have consulted a professional

Show the builder a complete summary of what will be deployed — name, ticker, chain, launch platform, image, fee recipient — and wait for final go-ahead.

---

## Post-Launch Guidance

After deployment:

1. **Run a Quick Intel scan** — Verify the deployed token looks clean externally. Address any flags before promoting.
2. **Monitor fee accumulation** — Help the builder understand what they're earning and remind them of tax implications.
3. **Track token performance** — Use Tator to check price, volume, holder count.
4. **Recommend a claim cadence** — Periodic fee claims rather than letting them accumulate (better for tax tracking, reduces smart contract exposure).
5. **Flag reinvestment risk** — If the builder mentions putting all their fees back into trading, remind them: taxes are owed on the income regardless of what happens to the reinvested funds.
6. **Revisit the Launch Stack** — If volume is dropping, diagnose which layer is failing. Hook still working? Engine still running? Story still compelling? Moat holding?

---

## What This Skill Is NOT

- **Not tax advice.** General information is provided to increase awareness. Not a substitute for professional counsel.
- **Not legal advice.** Token launches may have securities law implications. Consult a securities attorney if unsure.
- **Not a guarantee of profits.** Most tokens lose value. Creator fees depend entirely on trading volume.
- **Not a "get rich quick" tool.** This skill helps builders launch responsibly, keep more of what they earn, and understand what they're signing up for.

---

## Setup & Required Skills

This skill handles strategy, evaluation, and the pre-launch confirmation flow. When the builder is ready to deploy, the actual on-chain execution is handled by the **tator-trade** skill. Security scanning is handled by **quickintel-scan**. Both should be installed alongside this skill.

### Install All Three Skills

**Via ClawHub (recommended):**
```bash
npx clawhub install tator-launch-pad --force
npx clawhub install tator-trader --force
npx clawhub install quickintel-scan --force
```

### Requirements

- **A wallet you control** — Tator returns unsigned transactions, you sign them
- **Native token for gas** — ETH on Base (or other EVM chains), SOL on Solana
- **USDC for API costs** — $0.20 per Tator trade request, $0.03 per Quick Intel scan
  - Pay on Base (recommended, lowest fees), Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Unichain, Linea, MegaETH, or Solana
- **No API keys needed** — Tator and Quick Intel use x402 payment protocol, no subscriptions or accounts

Research (comparable tokens, market data, trending narratives) uses the platform's native search and analysis tools.

## Summary

Tator gives you the best fee split in the market (90% of the creator's pool fee share), full custody of your funds, and multi-chain deployment via Clanker and Pump.fun.

This skill gives you the strategy to make your launch matter and the honesty to make sure you understand what comes with it.

Build something worth talking about. Keep more of what you earn. Know what you owe.
