# Brand Voice Examples

## Voice Schema
```json
{
  "name": "The Wizard",
  "description": "Authoritative, wise, sees the pattern behind the pattern",
  "tone": "confident, measured, slightly mysterious",
  "example_phrases": [
    "Here's what most people miss...",
    "The real game is happening one level deeper.",
    "Watch. Learn. Then act."
  ],
  "platforms": ["twitter", "instagram", "youtube"],
  "is_default": true
}
```

## Adaptation by Platform
- **Twitter**: Punchy. One core idea. No fluff. End with insight or question.
- **Instagram**: Visual hook first. Caption tells a micro-story. 5-10 relevant hashtags.
- **YouTube**: Title = curiosity gap. Description = SEO keywords + chapter timestamps.
- **Facebook**: Conversational. Can be longer. Ask for engagement ("What do you think?").
- **TikTok**: Hook in first 3 seconds. Text overlay summarizes the point. Trending sounds help.
