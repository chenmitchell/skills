# 🏠 Zillow × Airbnb Matcher — Setup Guide

## What This Does

Ask your bot to search any US ZIP code. It instantly finds properties for sale that already have active Airbnb listings nearby — and calculates the investment numbers (cap rate, cash flow, mortgage, etc).

**Cost: $0** (uses RapidAPI free tier — 100 Airbnb + 600 Zillow searches/month)

---

## Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Free RapidAPI Key

1. Go to **https://rapidapi.com** → Sign up (free, no credit card needed)
2. Subscribe to these 2 APIs (click "Subscribe" → choose **Basic/Free** plan):
   - **Airbnb:** https://rapidapi.com/3b-data-3b-data-default/api/airbnb13
   - **Zillow:** https://rapidapi.com/apimaker/api/zillow-com1
3. Copy your API key (it's the same key for both — find it on any API page, top right under "X-RapidAPI-Key")

### Step 2: Install the Skill

SSH into your server and run:

```bash
# Go to your OpenClaw skills folder
cd ~/clawd/skills/zillow-airbnb-matcher

# Install (paste your RapidAPI key)
bash scripts/install.sh --rapidapi-key YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

If it runs the demo successfully, you're good!

### Step 3: Add Your Key to OpenClaw

Add this line to your OpenClaw `.env` file (usually `~/.clawdbot/.env` or `~/clawd/.env`):

```
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_key_here
```

Then restart OpenClaw:
```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Step 4: Test It

Send your bot any of these messages:

- `search airbnb 78704` → Austin TX
- `search airbnb 33139` → Miami Beach
- `search airbnb Nashville TN` → Nashville
- `airbnb demo` → Demo mode (no API needed)

## Tips

- **Compare ZIP codes**: `78704` vs `78745` — prices and returns vary a lot within the same city
- **Check STR permits**: Always google "[city] short term rental rules" before buying
- **Revenue estimates** assume 70% occupancy — conservative but realistic
- **Geo-matching** finds Airbnbs within ~150m of the for-sale property — it may be a neighbor's, not the exact same house
- **Popular STR markets**: 78704 (Austin), 33139 (Miami Beach), 37203 (Nashville), 92109 (San Diego), 32819 (Orlando)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "No API keys configured" | Add `RAPIDAPI_KEY=xxx` to your `.env` file |
| "RapidAPI rate limit hit" | Free tier = 100 Airbnb + 600 Zillow/month. Wait for reset or upgrade ($10/mo) |
| "0 matches found" | Normal! Not every ZIP has overlapping for-sale + Airbnb. Try a popular STR market |
| Bot doesn't respond | Restart OpenClaw: `openclaw gateway restart` |

---

## Free Tier Limits

| API | Free Requests/Month | Cost to Upgrade |
|-----|---------------------|-----------------|
| Airbnb (airbnb13) | 100 | $10/mo for 1,000 |
| Zillow (zillow-com1) | 600 | $10/mo for 5,000 |

At 100 searches/month you can check ~3 ZIP codes per day. Plenty for research.
