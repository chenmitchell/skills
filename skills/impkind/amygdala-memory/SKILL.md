# Amygdala Memory 🎭

**Emotional processing for AI agents.** Part of the AI Brain series.

## Status: 🚧 Under Development

This skill is being developed. Star/watch for updates!

## Concept

The amygdala processes emotions and assigns emotional significance to memories. This skill will give AI agents:

- **Persistent emotional states** that carry across interactions
- **Emotional tagging** of memories (this made me happy/frustrated/curious)
- **Mood influence** on response generation
- **Emotional memory** — remembering how things felt, not just what happened

## AI Brain Series

| Part | Function | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| [hippocampus](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/hippocampus) | Memory formation, decay, reinforcement | ✅ Live |
| **amygdala-memory** | Emotional processing | 🚧 Development |
| [basal-ganglia-memory](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/basal-ganglia-memory) | Habit formation | 🚧 Development |
| [anterior-cingulate-memory](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/anterior-cingulate-memory) | Conflict detection | 🚧 Development |
| [insula-memory](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/insula-memory) | Internal state awareness | 🚧 Development |

## Coming Soon

Based on neuroscience research on emotional processing and the role of the amygdala in memory consolidation.
