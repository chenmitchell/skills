# Food Trucks & Trailers — Austin

## Why Austin's Food Truck Scene Matters

Austin pioneered the upscale food trailer movement. What started as taco trucks became Michelin-level operations. Some of Austin's best food comes from trailers.

## Trucks That Became Restaurants

Some Austin favorites started as trucks:
- **Uchi** — Started pop-ups
- **Ramen Tatsu-ya** — Trailer first
- **Torchy's Tacos** — Trailer origin
- **East Side King** — Still operates trucks
- **Via 313** — Pizza from a truck

This progression is common — successful trucks get brick-and-mortar but often keep trailer locations.
