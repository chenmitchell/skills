# Choosing a Neighborhood — Austin

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Define Your Non-Negotiables

| Priority | Best Areas | Avoid |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Walk everywhere | Downtown, East Austin, SoCo | Suburbs |
| Best schools | Westlake, Cedar Park, Circle C | Manor, Del Valle |
| Lowest rent | Manor, Pflugerville, Round Rock | Downtown, Westlake |
| Near tech jobs (North) | Domain, Cedar Park | South Austin |
| Near tech jobs (Downtown) | East Austin, Mueller | Cedar Park |
| Nightlife | East Austin, Downtown, Rainey | Suburbs |
| Outdoor lifestyle | Zilker, Barton Hills, Bee Cave | North Austin |
| Lake access | Lakeway, Tarrytown, Bee Cave | East Austin |
| Diverse community | Pflugerville, East Austin | Westlake |

### Step 2: Budget Reality Check

| Monthly Rent | What You Get |
|--------------|--------------|
| $1,000-1,400 | Manor, Del Valle, Pflugerville — far out, car required |
| $1,400-1,800 | Round Rock, Cedar Park, North Loop — decent, not central |
| $1,800-2,200 | Mueller, East Austin, Domain — good locations |
| $2,200-2,800 | Downtown, Zilker, SoCo — prime locations |
| $2,800+ | Luxury downtown, Westlake — top tier |

**Rule of thumb:** Budget 30% of gross income for rent. Austin median is higher.

### Step 3: Commute Reality

**If working Downtown:**
- East Austin: 10-20 min
- Mueller: 15-25 min  
- SoCo/Zilker: 10-15 min
- Domain: 25-45 min
- Round Rock: 35-60 min

**If working at Domain/North:**
- Domain: 5-10 min
- Cedar Park: 15-25 min
- Downtown: 25-45 min
- Round Rock: 20-35 min
- South Austin: 35-50 min

**I-35 Rule:** Add 15-30 min to any estimate involving I-35 at rush hour.

## Red Flags When Apartment Hunting

### Listings to Question
- "Central Austin" that's actually Pflugerville
- Photos that don't show the building exterior
- Below-market pricing (scam or catch)
- "As-is" condition
- No in-unit photos of kitchen/bathroom
- Utilities not clearly disclosed

### Questions to Ask
- What's the parking situation? (Cost?)
- What internet providers service the building?
- When was HVAC last serviced? (Critical for summer)
- What are the noise levels? (6th Street proximity matters)
- Is there a move-in special? (Often negotiable)

### Visit in Person
- Drive the commute at rush hour
- Walk the neighborhood at night
- Check parking availability
- Talk to current residents if possible
- Visit on a weekend (noise levels differ)

---

## Rent vs. Buy Considerations

### Current Market (2026)
- Median home price: $550,000+
- Down payment needed: $110,000+ (20%)
- Property tax: ~2.1% ($11,550/year on median)
- Mortgage + tax + insurance: Often higher than rent

### When Buying Makes Sense
- Planning to stay 5+ years
- Can put 20% down
- Comfortable with property tax increases
- Want to build equity

### When Renting Makes Sense
- New to Austin (test neighborhoods)
- Staying less than 3 years
- Don't have 20% down
- Want flexibility

### Rent-to-Own Calculation
Monthly cost to own (mortgage + tax + insurance + maintenance) often exceeds rent for equivalent property. Run the numbers carefully.
