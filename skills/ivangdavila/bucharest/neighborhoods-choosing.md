## Step 5: Red Flags

### Avoid These Situations

1. **Ground floor in center** — Noise, security issues
2. **No metro access in budget area** — You'll be trapped
3. **"Central" that's not** — Always verify on map
4. **Unrenovated communist block** — Heating, plumbing issues
5. **Near clubs in Old Town** — Sleep impossible
6. **Far from any metro** — Unless you have car

### Questions to Ask Before Renting

1. How is heating controlled? (Central vs individual)
2. Is there parking? (If driving)
3. What floor? (Higher = quieter, no elevator in old buildings?)
4. Metro walking distance?
5. What's the block like? (Visit at different times)
6. Furnished or unfurnished?

---

## Step 6: Seasonal Considerations

### Summer (Jun-Aug)
- **AC matters**: Old buildings may not have it
- **Top floor**: Can be unbearably hot
- **Parks**: Near parks more valuable

### Winter (Dec-Feb)
- **Heating**: Critical, ask if included or metered
- **Central heating**: Old buildings on city schedule
- **Commute**: Metro preferable (weather)
