# Car Buying Guide

## Total Cost of Ownership

The sticker price is NOT what you pay. Calculate:

| Cost | Typical Range |
|------|---------------|
| Purchase price | Listed |
| Sales tax | 5-10% of price |
| Registration/title | $100-500 |
| Insurance (annual) | $1,000-3,000 |
| Fuel (annual) | $1,500-3,000 |
| Maintenance (annual) | $500-1,500 |

**Rule:** If monthly payment + insurance + fuel + maintenance/12 exceeds 15% of take-home pay, car is too expensive.

## New vs Used Decision

**Buy new when:**
- You want warranty coverage (3-5 years)
- Financing deals are exceptional (0% APR)
- You'll keep the car 8+ years
- Safety tech matters (ADAS features evolve fast)

**Buy used when:**
- You want to avoid 20-30% depreciation in year 1
- Budget is tight
- You're okay with 1-3 year old models with remaining warranty
- You can inspect or get pre-purchase inspection

**Sweet spot:** 2-3 year old certified pre-owned (CPO) — depreciation hit absorbed, warranty remaining.

## Price Negotiation

**Research before visiting:**
- Check Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, CarGurus for fair market value
- Know invoice price (what dealer paid) vs MSRP
- Search "[car model] dealer markup" to spot inflated pricing

**At the dealer:**
1. Never reveal your max budget
2. Focus on OUT-THE-DOOR price, not monthly payment
3. Get quotes from 3+ dealers via email first
4. Walk away if pressured — there's always another deal

**Dealer tricks to watch:**
- "What monthly payment works for you?" — they'll extend loan term to hit it
- Add-ons in finance office: gap insurance, extended warranty, paint protection — all negotiable or skip
- "This deal is only good today" — rarely true

## Used Car Inspection Checklist

**Before test drive:**
- [ ] Check for uneven panel gaps (accident repair)
- [ ] Look under the car for rust, leaks, damage
- [ ] Tires match and have even wear
- [ ] Check oil — milky = coolant leak, very dark = overdue change
- [ ] Cold start the engine (sellers pre-warm to hide issues)

**During test drive:**
- [ ] Accelerate hard once — hesitation or smoke?
- [ ] Brake hard once in safe area — pulls to one side?
- [ ] Listen for squeaks, rattles, grinding
- [ ] Test all electronics: AC, heat, radio, windows, locks
- [ ] Highway speed — vibration or pulling?

**After test drive:**
- [ ] Get vehicle history report (Carfax, AutoCheck)
- [ ] Check for open recalls at NHTSA.gov
- [ ] Pay $100-150 for independent pre-purchase inspection

**Note:** Individual models vary. Always check specific model-year reliability data.

## Financing Basics

**Get pre-approved BEFORE dealer visit:**
- Credit unions often have best rates
- Know your credit score (700+ = good rates)
- Compare APR, not just monthly payment

**Loan term advice:**
- 36-48 months: Higher payment, less interest, car paid off faster
- 60-72 months: Lower payment, more interest, risk of being "underwater"
- Never finance for 84+ months — you'll owe more than car is worth

**Down payment:** Aim for 20% to avoid negative equity.

## Insurance Before You Buy

Get insurance quotes BEFORE committing:
1. Call/quote online with exact VIN or year/make/model
2. Sports cars, luxury brands, high-theft models cost more
3. Teen or young driver? Expect 50-100% premium increase
4. Safety features (automatic braking, lane assist) often discount 5-15%

**Don't discover your dream car costs $400/month to insure AFTER you buy it.**
