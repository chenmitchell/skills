## Income Needed

### Rule of Thumb
Most landlords require **3x monthly rent** in gross income.

| Monthly Rent | Needed Gross Income | Annual Salary |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| $2,000 | $6,000/month | $72,000 |
| $2,500 | $7,500/month | $90,000 |
| $3,000 | $9,000/month | $108,000 |
| $3,500 | $10,500/month | $126,000 |
| $4,000 | $12,000/month | $144,000 |

### Reality Check
- **Miami salaries are lower** than NYC/SF for same jobs
- But no state income tax helps
- Many people spend more than 30% on rent here
