## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Budget Reality Check
| Monthly Rent Budget | Realistic Areas |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Under $1,500 | Hialeah, Homestead, West Kendall |
| $1,500-2,000 | Little Havana, North Miami, Kendall |
| $2,000-2,500 | Edgewater, Midtown, North Beach |
| $2,500-3,500 | Brickell, Wynwood, Coconut Grove |
| $3,500+ | SoBe, Key Biscayne, Coral Gables |

### Step 2: Non-Negotiables
Pick your top 2:
- [ ] Walk to beach
- [ ] Walk to restaurants/bars
- [ ] Quiet/residential
- [ ] Public transit
- [ ] Good schools
- [ ] Affordable
- [ ] Nightlife access
- [ ] Creative/art scene

### Step 3: Dealbreakers
Common Miami dealbreakers:
- **Need car:** Everywhere except Brickell + South Beach
- **Parking cost:** $300-500/month in Brickell/SoBe
- **Hurricane evacuation zone:** Barrier islands evacuate first
- **Tourist crowds:** South Beach year-round
- **Construction noise:** Brickell, Edgewater, Sunny Isles

### Step 4: Visit Before Signing
- Different areas feel different at **different times**
- Visit on a weekday AND weekend
- Visit day AND night
- Walk around, don't just drive through
- Try to find a **month-to-month** first month if possible

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll just Uber everywhere" | Gets expensive fast ($30-50/day) |
| "South Beach = best beach" | Tourists, noise. Key Biscayne/Haulover better |
| "Brickell has everything" | No beach, homogeneous, corporate |
| "Miami is affordable" | Lower salaries + high rent = tight budgets |
| "I don't need AC" | You absolutely need AC. Year-round. |
| "I'll figure out parking later" | Figure it out NOW. It's that bad. |

## Neighborhood vs. Building

In Miami, **building matters as much as neighborhood**:

- **Old Art Deco (SoBe):** Character but no amenities, old AC, thin walls
- **New high-rise (Brickell):** Pool, gym, concierge but generic, HOA fees
- **Duplex/House (Grove):** Privacy, yard but maintenance on you

**Questions to ask:**
1. HOA/condo fees? (Can be $500-1500/month extra)
2. Hurricane impact windows?
3. Building insurance status? (Post-Surfside requirement)
4. Reserve funds? (New FL law requires adequate reserves)
5. Special assessments coming?
