## Practical Tips

### Beach Essentials
- **Bring:** Sunscreen (reef-safe), water, towel
- **Don't bring:** Glass (illegal), valuable jewelry
- **Watch for:** Lifeguard flags (purple = jellyfish)

### Tipping

| Restaurants | 18-22% |
| Bars | $1-2/drink |
| Valet | $5-10 |
| Hotel housekeeping | $3-5/day |
| Uber/Lyft | Optional, 15-20% for good service |

### Safety
- Miami is generally safe in tourist areas
- **Avoid at night:** Overtown, Liberty City, parts of Little Haiti
- **Watch for:** Phone snatching on Ocean Drive, car break-ins
- **Don't leave valuables visible** in parked cars — ever

### Weather Prep
| Season | What to Expect | Bring |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Nov-Apr** | Perfect, 70-85°F | Light layers, sunscreen |
| **May-Oct** | Hot, humid, afternoon storms | Umbrella, rain jacket |
| **Hurricane Season** | June-Nov (peak Aug-Oct) | Travel insurance, flexibility |

**Afternoon storms:** Quick (30-60 min), plan indoor activity or wait it out with a drink.
