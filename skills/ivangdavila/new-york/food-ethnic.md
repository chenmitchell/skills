# NYC Ethnic Food by Neighborhood

## Chinatown — Manhattan vs Flushing

### Manhattan Chinatown (Canal St area)
- More touristy but still legit
- **Best for:** Cantonese BBQ, dim sum, HK-style cafes, bakeries
- Walkable from many Manhattan spots
- **Top spots:** Nom Wah Tea Parlor (oldest dim sum), Wo Hop (late night), Joe's Shanghai (soup dumplings)

### Flushing, Queens (7 train to Main St)
- Largest Chinatown in US
- More diverse regional cuisines: Sichuan, Dongbei, Xinjiang, Fujianese
- Less English, more authentic
- **Must-visit:** New World Mall food court (basement), Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao, White Bear ($10/dozen wontons in chili oil)

**Verdict:** Manhattan for convenience. Flushing for full experience.

## Little Italy — Skip or Go?

**Mostly skip.** Shrunk to 2 blocks on Mulberry St. Overpriced tourist traps.

**Exceptions:**
- **Ferrara Bakery** (since 1892) — Cannoli and espresso
- **Di Palo's** — Italian specialty grocery, excellent cheese

**Better Italian:** Arthur Avenue in the Bronx (the "real Little Italy")
