# NYC Food Overview

## The NYC Food Identity

NYC is arguably the best food city in America. Diverse, authentic, 24/7.

**What makes it special:**
- Every world cuisine represented authentically
- 24/7 availability — food at 4am is normal
- Quality at every price point (dollar slice to Michelin)
- Neighborhood-driven — each area has specialties

## Essential NYC Foods

### Pizza
- **NY-Style Slice:** Thin, foldable, crispy + chewy. THE classic.
- **Neapolitan:** Soft, doughy, charred. Knife and fork.
- **Sicilian/Square:** Thick, fluffy, chunky sauce.
- **Coal-Fired:** Extra char, smoky (John's, Arturo's).

### Bagels
NYC bagels = boiled then baked, chewy exterior, soft inside. Nothing like the rest of the country.

### Pastrami
Jewish deli culture is NYC heritage. The pastrami sandwich on rye is sacred.

### Hot Dogs
Street food staple. Papaya + hot dog combo is classic NYC.

### Cheesecake
NYC style = dense, creamy, no-frills. Served cold.
