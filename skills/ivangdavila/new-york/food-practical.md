## Practical Tips

### Reservations
- **Resy** — Trendy/fine dining
- **OpenTable** — Everything else
- **Walk-in?** — Fine for casual spots, lunch

### Cash vs Card
Many iconic spots are CASH ONLY:
- Peter Luger
- Lucali
- Many Chinatown spots

### Best Times to Eat
- **Lunch specials:** Many nice restaurants cheaper 11:30am-2pm
- **Early dinner:** 5:30pm beats waits
- **Late night:** Koreatown, East Village open late

### Outer Boroughs = Better Value
Queens and Brooklyn have best food-to-price ratio. Don't stay in Manhattan for every meal.
