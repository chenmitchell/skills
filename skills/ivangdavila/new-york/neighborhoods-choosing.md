|----------|--------------|
| Budget | |
| Commute time | |
| Safety | |
| Nightlife | |
| Families/quiet | |
| Food scene | |
| Community feel | |

## Step 2: Match to Profile

### Remote Worker, Quality of Life
1. **Greenpoint** — Quiet, walkable, waterfront
2. **Park Slope** — Parks, neighborhood feel
3. **Astoria** — Best value overall
4. **Carroll Gardens** — Charming, restaurants

## Step 3: Commute Reality Check

From neighborhood to Midtown (rush hour):

| Area | Time | Lines |
|------|------|-------|
| LIC | 10-15 min | 7 |
| UES | 15-20 min | 4/5/6 |
| UWS | 15-25 min | 1/2/3 |
| Williamsburg | 20-25 min | L |
| Park Slope | 25-35 min | F/G, R |
| Astoria | 20-30 min | N/W |
| Bushwick | 30-40 min | L, J/M/Z |
| Jackson Heights | 20-25 min | 7, E/F/M/R |
| Washington Heights | 30-40 min | A, 1 |

## Step 4: Visit Before Signing

**Always do:**
- Visit during day AND night
- Walk around 3+ blocks
- Check grocery/convenience nearby
- Take the commute (actual subway)
- Talk to someone on the street if possible

**Red flags:**
- Too quiet at night (no "eyes on street")
- Far from subway (10+ min walk)
- Only chain stores (no community)
- Broker rushing you

## The Golden Rule

**Live near work.** Cross-town commutes will break you.

- Work in FiDi? → Brooklyn Heights, DUMBO, LES
- Work in Midtown? → LIC, Astoria, UES, UWS
- Work in SoHo? → East Village, West Village, LES
- Work in Brooklyn? → Live in Brooklyn
