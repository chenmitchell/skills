# NYC Visitor Tips & Day Trips

## Tipping Culture (Essential)

NYC has strong tipping expectations. Service workers rely on tips.

| Service | Tip |
|---------|-----|
| **Restaurants** | 18-20% of pre-tax bill |
| **Bartenders** | $1-2 per drink |
| **Food delivery** | $3-5 or 15-20% |
| **Taxi/Uber** | 15-20% |
| **Hotel housekeeping** | $2-5/night |
| **Bellhop** | $1-2 per bag |

**Quick math:** Double the tax (~8.875%) for ~18% tip.

## NYC Etiquette

**Walking:**
- Walk on the RIGHT
- Don't stop suddenly mid-sidewalk
- Step aside to check phone
- Walk fast or get out of the way

**Subway:**
- Let people OFF before boarding
- Move to center of car
- Don't block doors
- Give up seats for elderly/pregnant/disabled

**General:**
- New Yorkers are busy, not rude
- Be direct but polite
- "Excuse me" works better than standing silently

## Walking Shoes ESSENTIAL

**You WILL walk 15,000-25,000 steps/day (7-12 miles).**

- **Best:** Well-broken-in sneakers
- **Avoid:** New shoes, heels, flip-flops
- **Bring:** Blister bandages
- **Surfaces:** Concrete, cobblestones, subway stairs

**Essential Apps:**
- **Citymapper** — Best NYC transit app
- **Google Maps** — Navigation

- **TodayTix** — Broadway discounts
- **Resy/OpenTable** — Reservations

## Best Times to Visit

**Best weather:** September-October, April-May

**Cheapest:** January-March (cold but fewer tourists)

**Avoid:** Thanksgiving week, Christmas-New Year's (crowds, prices)

**Holiday magic:** Early December (decorations, ice skating)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Trying to do too much** — Pick a neighborhood, explore deeply
2. **Eating in Times Square** — Walk 5 blocks for better food
3. **Taking taxis everywhere** — Subway is faster + cheaper
4. **Not booking ahead** — Popular attractions sell out
5. **Underpacking layers** — Weather changes fast
6. **Forgetting comfortable shoes** — You'll regret heels
7. **Not tipping properly** — 18-20% is expected
