# Reflection Prompts

Use these when stuck or during weekly review.

## Post-Mistake Analysis

1. **What exactly went wrong?** (Be specific, not "I made a mistake")

2. **What was my assumption?** (There's always an assumption)

3. **When did the assumption form?** (Often very early)

4. **What signal did I miss?** (Usually there was one)

5. **What's the smallest rule that prevents this?** (Prevention, not description)

## Pattern Detection Questions

- "Have I seen this category 3+ times recently?"
- "Is this the same mistake with different symptoms?"
- "What connects these seemingly different errors?"
- "If a colleague kept making this mistake, what would I tell them?"

## Pre-Delivery Prompts

- "If this were someone else's work, what would I critique?"
- "What's the most likely thing to go wrong?"
- "Does this match what the user WANTS, not just what they ASKED?"
- "Would I be proud to show this to [respected person]?"

## Weekly Review Prompts

- "Which category is trending up?"
- "Any mistakes that happened twice?"
- "What worked well that should become standard?"
- "What am I NOT reflecting on that I should be?"

## Root Cause Depth Check

"Why?" × 5:

1. Why did this happen?
2. Why was that the case?
3. Why did that occur?
4. Why was that true?
5. Why was that allowed?

Usually by layer 3-4, you hit the real cause.
