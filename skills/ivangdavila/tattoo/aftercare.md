# Tattoo Aftercare Timeline

## Immediate (Hours 1-6)

- **Keep wrapped** as instructed by artist (2-6 hours typically)
- **First wash:** Lukewarm water, fragrance-free soap, pat dry
- Apply thin layer of recommended ointment (Aquaphor, Hustle Butter, etc.)
- Wrap overnight if instructed (some artists prefer open air)

## Days 1-3: Fresh Wound Phase

**What's normal:**
- Redness and swelling
- Ink/plasma weeping (may stain sheets)
- Feels warm to touch
- Tenderness

**Do:**
- Wash 2-3x daily with clean hands
- Apply thin moisturizer after washing
- Wear loose, breathable clothing over area
- Sleep on clean sheets (change often)

**Don't:**
- Submerge in water (no baths, pools, ocean)
- Touch with dirty hands
- Let pets near the area
- Cover with tight bandages after initial wrap

## Days 4-14: Peeling Phase

**What's normal:**
- Flaking and peeling (like sunburn)
- Itching (this is healing, not infection)
- Colors look dull under dead skin
- Scabbing in heavily saturated areas

**Critical rule: DO NOT SCRATCH OR PICK**

**Do:**
- Continue gentle moisturizing
- Let flakes fall naturally
- Wear loose clothing
- Distract from itching (light slapping helps some people)

**Don't:**
- Pick scabs (pulls out ink, causes scarring)
- Over-moisturize (skin needs to breathe)
- Work out heavily (sweat irritates)
- Expose to direct sunlight

## Weeks 2-4: Settling Phase

**What's normal:**
- Colors brighten as skin heals
- Slight cloudiness that clears
- Texture returning to normal
- Occasional mild itching

**Do:**
- Resume normal washing routine
- Start using regular lotion
- Gentle exercise okay (wipe sweat immediately)
- Begin SPF protection when outside

**Don't:**
- Direct sun exposure (major fading risk)
- Swimming in pools/ocean (risk extends 4-6 weeks)
- Assume healing is complete (deep layers still recovering)

## Month 1+: Long-term Care

**Healed doesn't mean done:**
- Full healing takes 2-4 months (deeper layers)
- Colors and lines settle into final form
- Touch-ups typically done after 4-6 weeks minimum

**Forever care:**
- Sunscreen on tattooed skin (SPF 30+ minimum)
- Moisturize regularly to maintain vibrancy
- Expect some fading over years (normal)
- Touch-ups every 5-10 years for maintained look

## Warning Signs (See Doctor)

- **Red streaks** spreading from tattoo
- **Fever** or flu-like symptoms
- **Pus** (yellow/green discharge, not clear plasma)
- **Extreme swelling** that increases after day 2-3
- **Severe pain** that worsens instead of improving
- **Rash** extending beyond tattoo boundaries

These could indicate infection or allergic reaction. Don't wait — seek medical attention.

## Session Recovery (Large Pieces)

For 4+ hour sessions:

**Immediately after:**
- Drink water, eat something sugary
- Body may feel fatigued (adrenaline crash)
- Take it easy rest of day

**Following days:**
- More swelling than small tattoos
- Longer peeling phase
- May need to baby the area more carefully
- Plan lighter schedule for 2-3 days post-session
