# Positioning Strategy

## Overview
Positioning is the single most important strategic decision a solopreneur makes. It determines who you attract, what you can charge, and whether you're memorable or forgettable. Bad positioning = competing on price against everyone. Good positioning = being the obvious, only choice for a specific group. This playbook builds your position from the ground up and turns it into messaging.

---

## Step 1: Understand What You're Positioning Against

You are not just competing against other products. You're competing against every alternative your customer has — including doing nothing. Map the full competitive set:

- **Direct alternatives:** Products that solve the exact same problem.
- **Indirect alternatives:** Different approaches to the same outcome.
- **The status quo:** Whatever they're doing RIGHT NOW. This is often the strongest competitor.

For each alternative, write one sentence: what it does well, and what it fails at. This gap analysis feeds directly into your position.

## Step 2: Choose a Positioning Archetype

Pick the archetype that fits your situation. Each dictates a different strategy.

### Archetype A: The Specialist
**"We do one thing, and we do it better than anyone."**
- Best when: The market is full of generalist tools, and one specific use case is underserved.
- How it works: You narrow the scope ruthlessly. Fewer features, tighter focus, deeper expertise.
- Example: "The only invoicing tool built for freelance designers" (vs. generic invoicing tools like FreshBooks).

### Archetype B: The Simplifier
**"We do what everyone else does, but without the bloat."**
- Best when: Dominant competitors are complex, over-featured, and intimidating to your target customer.
- How it works: You strip away everything unnecessary. Fewer options = faster decisions = happier users.
- Example: "Project management for people who hate project management tools."

### Archetype C: The Niche Aggregator
**"We bring together things that are currently scattered."**
- Best when: Customers use 3-5 separate tools to accomplish a workflow, and the switching between them is the pain.
- How it works: You combine the critical pieces into one seamless experience.
- Example: "One place to manage client contracts, invoices, and communication — no more app-switching."

### Archetype D: The Opposite
**"We deliberately do the opposite of what the market leader does."**
- Best when: The market leader has made a strategic choice that a significant segment of customers disagrees with.
- How it works: You position yourself as the anti-[leader]. Every decision is framed as the alternative.
- Example: If the market leader charges per-user and scales expensively → you offer flat-rate unlimited users.

### Archetype E: The Category Creator
**"This problem didn't have a name before. Now it does, and we invented the solution."**
- Best when: You're solving a problem that customers feel but haven't seen a product category for yet.
- How it works: You name the category, define what it means, and position yourself as the creator/authority.
- Example: "Automated client health scores" — if no one called it that before, you name and own it.

## Step 3: Write Your Positioning Statement

Use this template. Every word earns its place.

```
FOR [specific customer segment]
WHO [has a specific problem or need]
[YOUR BRAND] IS A [product category]
THAT [delivers a specific, measurable benefit]
UNLIKE [primary alternative — competitor or status quo]
WHO [what that alternative does or fails to do]
WE [the key difference that makes your benefit possible]
```

**Fill it in. Then cut it down to 2-3 sentences max for external use.** The full template is internal strategy. The shortened version becomes your elevator pitch and website headline.

**Example (full internal version):**
"For freelance developers managing 3-8 client projects, who struggle with keeping clients informed without spending hours on updates, DevPulse is a project status tool that delivers automatic client-facing progress reports in under 2 minutes per project. Unlike Basecamp or Asana, which are built for large teams and require manual updates, DevPulse pulls data directly from your existing workflow and generates reports automatically."

**Example (shortened for external use):**
"Automatic client progress reports for freelance developers. No manual updates. No bloated PM tools. Just done."

## Step 4: Validate Your Position

Before committing, stress-test against these questions:

1. **Is it believable?** Can you actually deliver on this position given your current skills and resources?
2. **Is it important?** Does your target customer actually care about this differentiator? (Check against customer discovery notes — did this come up unprompted?)
3. **Is it defensible?** Can a well-funded competitor copy this position in 3 months? If yes, it's not strong enough. Look for positions rooted in your unique access, data, or niche expertise.
4. **Is it specific enough?** If your position could apply to 20 other businesses, it's too generic. Tighten it.
5. **Is it testable?** Can a customer experience the difference in the first 5 minutes of using your product? Position should be felt immediately, not only understood intellectually.

## Step 5: Translate Position Into Messaging Hierarchy

Your positioning statement feeds every piece of messaging you create. Build a messaging hierarchy — a ranked list of messages, ordered by importance.

**Level 1 — The headline (one line):** The single most important thing to communicate. Usually the core benefit.
**Level 2 — The sub-headline (one sentence):** Adds context or specificity to the headline.
**Level 3 — Supporting claims (2-3 bullet points):** Evidence or features that back up the headline promise.
**Level 4 — Social proof (1 line):** A number, a quote, or a result that makes the claim credible.

**Example:**
- L1: "Client reports, on autopilot."
- L2: "Freelance developers save 4+ hours/week and keep clients in the loop without lifting a finger."
- L3: "Pulls from your existing tools automatically. Generates reports in your brand. Sends on your schedule."
- L4: "Used by 200+ freelancers. Average time saved: 4.2 hours/week."

This hierarchy goes on your homepage, in your pitch deck, in your outreach emails — adapted to each format but keeping the same core message and order.

## Step 6: Position Consistency Across Touchpoints

Your position must be felt everywhere, not just stated on one page.

| Touchpoint | How Position Shows Up |
|---|---|
| Website homepage | Headline + sub-headline = your L1 and L2 |
| Sales conversations | Lead with L1, back up with L3 and L4 |
| Outreach emails | Subject line reflects L1. Body delivers L2 + one L3 point. |
| Onboarding | First experience demonstrates the core differentiator |
| Proposals | Open with the position, close with proof |
| Social media | Content consistently reinforces the same theme |

**Audit rule:** Every 30 days, pick one touchpoint and check: does this still accurately reflect the position? If the product has evolved but the messaging hasn't, fix the messaging.

## Positioning Pitfalls
- Trying to be everything to everyone. That's not a position, it's a panic.
- Positioning based on features ("We have X feature"). Position on outcomes ("You achieve Y result").
- Ignoring the status quo as a competitor. Many customers will do nothing rather than switch. Your position must make "do nothing" feel worse than switching.
- Setting a position and never revisiting. Markets shift. Revisit quarterly.
