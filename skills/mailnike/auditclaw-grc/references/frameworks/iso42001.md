# ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Framework Reference

## Overview
ISO/IEC 42001:2023 specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an **Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)**. It is the first international standard for AI governance.

## Structure
ISO 42001 follows the Harmonized Structure (HS) common to all ISO management system standards (like ISO 27001, ISO 9001) with AI-specific requirements.

## Clauses

| Clause | Name | Focus |
|--------|------|-------|
| 4 | Context of the Organization | Understanding the AI context, stakeholder needs, AIMS scope |
| 5 | Leadership | Leadership commitment, AI policy, roles and responsibilities |
| 6 | Planning | AI risk assessment, objectives, treatment plans |
| 7 | Support | Resources, competence, awareness, communication, documentation |
| 8 | Operation | AI system lifecycle, risk treatment, third-party management |
| 9 | Performance Evaluation | Monitoring, internal audit, management review |
| 10 | Improvement | Nonconformity, corrective action, continual improvement |
| Annex A | AI Controls | Reference controls for AI risk management |

## Annex A Controls

| Control Area | Focus |
|-------------|-------|
| A.2 AI Policies | AI governance policies and principles |
| A.3 Internal Organization | AI roles, responsibilities, competencies |
| A.4 Resources for AI Systems | Data quality, computing resources, tools |
| A.5 AI System Impact Assessment | Impact analysis, stakeholder impact, societal impact |
| A.6 AI System Lifecycle | Development, testing, deployment, monitoring, retirement |
| A.7 Data for AI Systems | Data governance, quality, privacy, bias in data |
| A.8 Information for Interested Parties | Transparency, explainability, disclosure |
| A.9 Use of AI Systems | Human oversight, monitoring, incident handling |
| A.10 Third-Party and Customer Relationships | Supply chain AI risk, customer responsibilities |

## Key Requirements for Compliance
1. **AI Policy**: Documented AI policy aligned with organizational objectives
2. **AI Impact Assessment**: Systematic assessment of AI system impacts on individuals and society
3. **AI Risk Management**: AI-specific risk identification, analysis, and treatment
4. **Data Governance**: Data quality management, bias detection, privacy considerations
5. **Transparency**: Explainability of AI decisions, disclosure to stakeholders
6. **Human Oversight**: Human-in-the-loop / human-on-the-loop controls
7. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of AI system performance and fairness
8. **Incident Response**: AI-specific incident handling (bias incidents, model failures)

## Typical Evidence
- AI Management System documentation
- AI Policy and principles statement
- AI Impact Assessment reports
- AI Risk Register
- Data quality management procedures
- Model validation and testing reports
- Bias monitoring dashboards
- Explainability documentation
- Human oversight procedures
- AI incident reports and root cause analyses
- Training records for AI practitioners
- Third-party AI assessment results
