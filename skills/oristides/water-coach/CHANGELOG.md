# Changelog - Water Coach

All notable changes to this skill will be documented in this file.

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-18

### 🚀 Major Features

#### New CLI Architecture (Option C)
- Unified CLI: `water_coach.py <namespace> <command>`
- Namespaces: `water`, `body`, `analytics`
- Better agent clarity on available commands

#### Audit Trail System
- **Two timestamps**: `logged_at` (when user told you) + `drank_at` (when user actually drank)
- **Message ID**: Auto-captures conversation message ID for proof
- **Audit function**: `water audit <message_id>` - retrieves entry + conversation context
- **Cumulative calculated at query time** - not stored (prevents data corruption on edits)

#### Dynamic Scheduling (Coach Mode)
- Per-hour limits instead of per-day (max 2/hour)
- Aggressiveness curve: easier to trigger near cutoff time
- Can re-trigger multiple times per day

### ✨ Improvements

#### Flexible Paths
- No hardcoded paths (e.g., `/home/oriel/`)
- Uses environment variables and relative paths
- Works on any machine with OpenClaw

#### Body Metrics Integration
- `water set_body_weight` logs to both config AND body_metrics.csv
- Auto-calculates BMI

#### User Choice for Goals
- weight × 35 = default suggestion only
- Agent MUST confirm goal with user at setup
- Agent asks to update goal when weight changes

### 📋 Commands Added

# Water
