# CacheForge

Primary entrypoint for CacheForge on OpenClaw.

Install `cacheforge` first. It bootstraps companion skills when needed, then routes workflow tasks to:

1. `cacheforge-setup` (onboarding)
2. `cacheforge-ops` (billing/upstream/keys)
3. `cacheforge-stats` (usage/savings telemetry)

## Install

```bash
clawhub install cacheforge
```

## What It Does

CacheForge is an OpenAI-compatible gateway for agent workflows. It can reduce wasted LLM spend and improve repeat-turn performance (results vary by provider/workload).

Vault Mode (Pro) targets tool-heavy agents.
