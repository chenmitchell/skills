# Security

## Safety Posture

- This skill is orchestration-focused and does not execute destructive system actions by default.
- Companion installation is limited to ClawHub skill installs.
- No secrets are stored in this skill repository.

## Secrets Handling

- Use environment variables for tenant keys (`CACHEFORGE_API_KEY`).
- Do not commit API keys, tokens, cookies, or webhook secrets.

## Reporting

If you discover a security issue related to CacheForge skills, report privately to the CacheForge team before public disclosure.
