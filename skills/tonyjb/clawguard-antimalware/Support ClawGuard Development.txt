# Support ClawGuard Development 🛡️

ClawGuard is completely free, open-source, and runs locally with zero telemetry. 

Writing active defense systems, analyzing the latest ClawHavoc payloads, and maintaining up-to-date honeypots takes a significant amount of time. If this tool intercepted an attack or saved your engine's API keys, please consider supporting the ongoing development. 

Your support goes directly toward funding test-environments and threat research to keep the OpenClaw ecosystem safe.
