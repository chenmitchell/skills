Frost Sentinel (Lite): Quick Start Guide
Welcome to the Community Edition of the Frost Sentinel. This lightweight, local-first OpenClaw agent monitors your local weather via Open-Meteo and sends automated WhatsApp or Telegram alerts when extreme temperatures (Frost or Heat) threaten your location.

Phase 1: Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following ready on your local machine:

OpenClaw Engine: Installed and running (v2.4+).

Notification Bridge: An active local bridge (e.g., WhatsApp or Telegram) running on localhost.

Phase 2: Installation
This agent operates entirely locally. Your data is never sent to a third-party server.

Download the frost-sentinel-community folder from ClawHub.

Place the entire folder into your OpenClaw skills/ directory.

Restart your OpenClaw Engine to register the new web_fetch and notify permissions.

Phase 3: Setting Your Location
The Sentinel needs to know what sky it is watching.

Open your OpenClaw terminal or linked chat interface.

The Sentinel will automatically send a welcome prompt.

Reply with your Operating ZIP/Postcode. The agent will automatically convert this to GPS coordinates for the Open-Meteo API and save it locally.

Phase 4: The Daily Cycle
The Community Edition operates on a single daily cycle:

04:00 PM (16:00 Local): The agent pulls the 24-hour forecast. If overnight lows are forecast below 3°C, or daytime highs exceed 32°C, you will receive an immediate alert through your notification bridge.

🛑 Upgrading for Commercial Operations
This Community Edition is designed for basic residential or hobbyist monitoring. If you are operating a commercial nursery, tree farm, or landscaping business, a simple frost alert is not enough to protect your bottom line.

Ground-Lock Predictor: Multi-night freeze tracking to warn you when soil is too hard to dig.
